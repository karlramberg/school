CS 484 Advanced Java
Final Exam Part 2

For this final exam I used Maven to set dependencies such as MVC and Hibernate.
This configuration was copied from my final project. The structure of the code
is similar to my final project as well. I made com.entity to hold Student and
StudentDetail entity classes. I made com.hibernate to hold Hibernate code such
as the DAO and Transactional service. Finally, I made com.mvc to hold the
StudentController class for managing page views and forms. The controller class
will be called by the jsp pages. The controller will call service functions
which then calls DAO functions. The DAO functions directly use hibernate
functions to request or update data from the student database.

My two MVC view pages are home.jsp and student-form.jsp. home.jsp does a simple
database request for every student. The student's details are grab alongside 
them because the two entities were mapped using EAGER loading. The student and 
their details are listed in a nice table on the home page. student-form.jsp
handles both adding a new student and updating an existing one. When you click 
"Add New Student" is shows a blank form to fill in. When you click "Edit" on a
table row is populates the form so you can edit it.
