When using Hibernate to control a SQL database with Java, you have to be careful
for date formatting to be correct. 

SQL has the "datetime" type.
Java has the "java.util.Date" class.

The @Temporal annotation is Hibernate's way of marking a field as similar to an SQL
datetime. Additionally you can use TemporalType.DATE to keep only the date (year, month, day) and 
not the time part (hours, minutes, seconds). We do that with the Employee class 
because it doesn't make sense to keep track of the exact time an employee 
started, only the calendar day.

Java also has a convenient class called SimpleDateFormat. It is used to convert
strings to a Date object. It is much more convenient for users and programmers
to create dates this way.

With all of these tools together we can create a date with a string such as
"2021-11-03". SimpleDateFormat will convert that to a java.util.Date object.
Hibernate will take that instance data and convert it to the proper SQL type
because we marked the field with @Temporal(TemporalType.DATE).
