My encryption method is fairly simple. 
When starting to encrypt is gets a timestamp (milliseconds since Jan 1, 1970).
It adds that number to the beginning of the encrypted file.
Each character gets incremented by that timestamp, this makes each encryption different from the next.
When decrypting the number is read off the encrypted file first.
Each character is then decremented by the timestamp.
